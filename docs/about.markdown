# About

At **ChristIsMyKing.com**, our journey began with a simple yet profound desire: to leave behind a legacy of Godly encouragment for our children, ensuring that they have the resources to learn, grow, and mature in holiness.

## Our Vision

As parents, we recognize the importance of imparting values, morals, and faith to the next generation. The digital age has brought a plethora of information to our fingertips, but discerning the valuable from the vacuous becomes an ever-increasing challenge. Our aim is to provide a wellspring of content that consistently points to Christ, ensuring that our children—and indeed all who visit this site—have a reliable resource to bolster their faith.

## Do Not Empty The Cross Of It's Power - 1 Corinthians 1:17

Our mission isn't driven by worldly metrics of success, such as educaiton, eloquence, fame or fortune. Instead, our heart's desire is to glorify God in everything we do. We are not seeking to make a name for ourselves, but to communicate God's word as effectively as we can. This effort a labor of love to glorify Christ above all. We exist to serve, encourage, and edify in Christ's name.

## A Gentle Reminder

While we strive to provide content rooted in the Word of God, it's vital to remember Jesus' commandment: *to be taught by the Holy Spirit.* Every believer should practice discernment when receiving teachings, be it from this platform or any other source.

*"But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you." - John 14:26*

Let the Holy Spirit be your guiding light as you navigate your faith journey. Trust in Him to lead, correct, and instruct.

We pray that this platform becomes a blessing in your walk with Christ. May you draw closer to Him each day, standing firm in faith and shining His light in every corner of your life.

**God bless you abundantly.**
