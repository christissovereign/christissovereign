<p>Our mission isn’t driven by worldly metrics of success, such as educaiton, eloquence, fame or fortune. Instead, our heart’s desire is to glorify God in everything we do. We are not seeking to make a name for ourselves, but to communicate God’s word as effectively as we can. This effort a labor of love to glorify Christ above all. We exist to serve, encourage, and edify in Christ’s name.</p>

<h2 id="a-gentle-reminder">A Gentle Reminder</h2>
